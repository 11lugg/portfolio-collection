          <h3>Port Police</h3>
          <p>
            I began my working life doing part time jobs during my full time
            college studies. My first career move however was working in the
            port of Bristol Police. I had always wanted to be a police officer
            as a child. I wanted to run around shooting bad guys.

        <div id="Paralegal" class="tabcontent">
          <h3>Paralegal</h3>
          <p>
            During my time in the police I wanted learn more about how laws are
            created and how they evolve and I began a law degree with the open
            university. During this time I wanted to get a real world
            understanding of the industry and began working as a paralegal in a
            conveyancing team. I realised that law wasn't right for me, purely
            because of the competition.

          <p>
            Very randomly and during my employment as a paralegal, I was walking
            down the street and was stopped by a casting agent. She said I
            looked perfect for a role they were casting extras for and gave me
            her business card. Naturally, I had to find out more and was cast in
            Wolf Hall for 3 months. I was incredibly lucky and met people from
            all different backgrounds. I played a main servant of Henry VIII
            which meant that whenever he was on the scene, you will find me
            lurking behind.

          <h3>Travelling Australia and working in sales</h3>
          <p>
            I had always planned to go to Australia and following Wolf Hall, I
            thought there was no better time. During my time travelling I lived
            and worked in Sydney, Melbourne and Broome (WA). To support myself,
            I got into commission only sales jobs, selling ADT alarm systems and
            charities on the streets. I loved every minute of it; the sights,
            the climate and the people were great. I also saw alot of
            similarities between studying law and sales.

          <p>
            All good things come to an end. I loved Australia but I missed my
            family and friends. It was time to come home. Once I returned, I
            wanted to continue in sales and learn more. The first opportunity
            came in the form of Universal outdoor. I was selling advertising
            space to businesses in shopping centres, cinema and golf clubs.

            Unfortuntely, 7 months after I started, Universal Outdoor went into
            administration and I was out of work. At the time, I had moved from
            Weston-super-Mare to Bath and stumbled on the founder of an app
            called Ordable (later renamed Ordoo). He had developed an MVP and
            was trialling it at a coffee shop; which I just happened to be at. I
            introduced myself and thought the concept sounded exciting and I
            started and headed up the business development and account
            management efforts. This has to have been the best hands on
            experience I have ever had. I had the freedom to create and iterate
            on processes, I had a say in the product development, I pitched on a
            quarterly basis to the board and I pitched for investment. The
            commercial accumen and the market knowledge I gained was
            invalueable.

          <h3>Contracting for startups</h3>
          <p>
            As much as I love Ordoo, being part of a startup that hasn't found
            product market fit (yet) means is reliant on ongoing investment
            until it does. I couldn't personally afford to stay. I still hold my
            shares in Ordoo however, and I still advise the team. The startup
            environment is brilliant and being part of that community allows you
            to get recognised. I was being approached by a number of startups
            needing help with their sales and account management efforts. How
            could I refuse?!

          <h3>District sales manager for Quandoo</h3>
          <p>
            I was headhunted by a growth stage food tech company called Quandoo,
            looking to expand its footprint in the South West. This company had
            found product market fit and I saw this as a great opportunity in
            taking my skills to the next level.
